# Data-analysis-project-Data-Driven-Insights-for-Indian-Startup-Growth

In this project, I explored the funding for Indian start-ups from 2018 to 2021 to help my hypothetical team which is trying to venture into the Indian start-up ecosystem make an informed decision.

I used Python and Jupyter for this project.


## Column names and description:

Company/Brand: Name of the company/start-up. String.

Founded: Year start-up was founded. String.

Sector: Sector of operation. String.

What it does: Description of Company. String.

Founders: Founders of the Company. String.

Investor: Investors. String.

Amount($): Funds raised. Float.

## Hypothesis
(H1): The sector in which a startup operates can play a significant role in contributing to its success in India

## Conclusion
Accept the Alternative hypothesis as a startup sector that operates can play a significant role in contributing  (Fintech, Retail, Education).

## Recommendation
To the Team, Fintech start-ups headquartered in Mumbai received significantly higher amounts per deal than the average startup, so prioritize this intersection. Secondly, you may have to seek alternative sources of funding within the first year of operation as you look forward to a funding round. You may also research further into the other key sectors and locations to be better informed on available options.
